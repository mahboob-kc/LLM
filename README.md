# Language Model Projects

Welcome to the Language Model Projects repository! This collection of projects showcases various applications and experiments using language models, particularly focusing on the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT.

## About

Language models have revolutionized natural language processing tasks by providing state-of-the-art performance in various domains such as text generation, summarization, sentiment analysis, and more. This repository serves as a hub for exploring different use cases and implementations of language models.

## Projects

### 1. Text Generation

- Description: Generate coherent and contextually relevant text using pre-trained language models.
- Technologies: Python, Hugging Face Transformers library.
- Example: Generating creative stories, poetry, or dialogue.

### 2. Text Summarization

- Description: Automatically condense large documents or articles into concise summaries while retaining the essential information.
- Technologies: Python, Transformers library, BART model.
- Example: Summarizing news articles, research papers, or long-form content.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis

- Description: Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a given piece of text.
- Technologies: Python, NLTK, Transformers library.
- Example: Analyzing product reviews, social media comments, or customer feedback.

### 4. Chatbots

- Description: Create conversational agents capable of engaging in human-like dialogue.
- Technologies: Python, Transformers library, conversational AI frameworks.
- Example: Building customer service bots, virtual assistants, or interactive storytelling agents.
